          Users want to find answers to their questions quickly and data<br/> shows
          that people really care about how quickly their pages load.<br/> The Search
          team announced speed would be a ranking signal for<br/> desktop searches in
          2010 and as of this month(July 2018), page<br/> speed will be a ranking
          factor for mobile searches too.<br/><br/> <br/>If you're a developer working on site,
          now is a good time to<br/> evaluate your performance using our speed tools.
          Think about how<br/> performance affects the user experience of your pages
          and consider<br/> measuring a variety of real-world user-centric
          performance metrics.<br/><br/> Are you shipping to much JavaScript? Too many
          images? Images<br/> and JavaScript are most significant contributors to the
